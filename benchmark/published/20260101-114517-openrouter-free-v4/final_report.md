# Final Benchmark Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents a benchmark evaluation of five language models for extracting structured data from Thai tour posters. The models were assessed on their ability to accurately extract event information (date, time, venue, location) and artist details from poster images and represent it in a standardized JSON format. The primary metric is the "app_quality_score," a composite score reflecting the overall quality and usability of the extracted data for the ArtistCalendar application. The ground truth used for this evaluation is of silver quality. The models were evaluated on 58 posters, with varying numbers of posters judged for each model. All models were run with a temperature of 0.1 and a seed value of 23.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 58 Thai tour poster images sourced from Instagram URLs listed in `docs/test_poster_urls.txt`. These posters were selected to represent a variety of design styles and OCR challenges. The dataset is intended for benchmarking model accuracy in poster-to-JSON extraction. The ground truth is silver, meaning it was generated by LLMs and not human-verified.

## Methodology

Each model was used to extract structured data from the poster images, producing a JSON output. The extracted data was then compared to the silver ground truth using a suite of metrics, including schema adherence, event matching, and field-level accuracy. The "app_quality_score" was calculated as a weighted composite of these metrics. Statistical significance was assessed using bootstrap confidence intervals and p-values, with 1,000 resamples and an alpha of 0.05.

## Results

The following table summarizes the performance of each model:

| Model                                                 | app_quality_score | total_cost_usd | schema_strict_rate |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| openrouter-google_gemma-3-12b-it_free                | 75.66             | 2.308029       | 0.897              |
| openrouter-google_gemma-3-27b-it_free                | 72.48             | 2.308029       | 0.81               |
| openrouter-google_gemma-3-4b-it_free                 | 60.22             | 2.308029       | 0.552              |
| openrouter-nvidia_nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl_free       | 73.85             | 2.308029       | 0.862              |
| openrouter-qwen_qwen-2.5-vl-7b-instruct_free         | 70.38             | 2.308029       | 0.69               |

## Interpretation

The `openrouter-google_gemma-3-12b-it_free` model achieved the highest app quality score (75.66) and schema strict rate (0.897). The `openrouter-google_gemma-3-4b-it_free` model had the lowest app quality score (60.22) and schema strict rate (0.552).

Statistical comparisons reveal significant differences in app quality scores between several models. Specifically, `openrouter-google_gemma-3-12b-it_free` performed significantly better than `openrouter-google_gemma-3-4b-it_free`. Similarly, `openrouter-google_gemma-3-27b-it_free` outperformed `openrouter-google_gemma-3-4b-it_free`, and both `openrouter-nvidia_nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl_free` and `openrouter-qwen_qwen-2.5-vl-7b-instruct_free` showed significantly better performance than `openrouter-google_gemma-3-4b-it_free`.

All models had the same total cost, as they were all free. Therefore, the primary tradeoff is between accuracy and model complexity. The Gemma 3-12b model appears to offer the best balance of accuracy and efficiency.

## Limitations

The primary limitation of this benchmark is the use of silver ground truth. While this allows for rapid iteration, it introduces potential biases and inaccuracies compared to human-verified gold ground truth. The dataset size is also relatively small (58 posters), which may limit the generalizability of the results. The dataset is also geographically biased towards Thailand and Thai-language content.

## Recommendations

Based on these results, the `openrouter-google_gemma-3-12b-it_free` model appears to be the most promising for extracting structured data from Thai tour posters for the ArtistCalendar application. However, further evaluation with gold ground truth is recommended to confirm these findings and assess the model's performance in a production setting. Future benchmarks should also consider expanding the dataset to include a wider range of poster designs and languages.
