Extract structured tour data from the image.

Return a single JSON object and nothing else. No markdown or code fences.
Follow the schema exactly (same keys, same nesting, no extra keys):
{
  "artist_name": string,
  "instagram_handle": string|null,
  "tour_name": string|null,
  "contact_info": string|null,
  "source_month": "YYYY-MM",
  "poster_confidence": number (0-1),
  "events": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "event_name": string|null,
      "venue": string|null,
      "city": string|null,
      "province": string|null,
      "country": string,
      "time": "HH:MM"|null,
      "ticket_info": string|null,
      "status": "active"|"cancelled"|"postponed",
      "confidence": number (0-1)
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Use double quotes for all keys/strings.
- If a required string is unknown, use "" (empty string).
- For optional strings use null when unknown.
- source_month must be YYYY-MM; infer from event dates or poster text.
- dates must be YYYY-MM-DD; omit events without a valid date.
- time must be HH:MM or null.
- status must be one of: active, cancelled, postponed.
- poster_confidence and confidence must be numbers between 0 and 1.
- Use Thailand if country is not specified.
- Keep text as written; do not translate or invent details.
- If unsure, use null and lower confidence.

Event construction (date-first):
- Create an event only when a date is explicitly present in the image.
- Anchor each event to its date line. Only attach venue/city/province/time that appear on the same line as the date or the immediate adjacent line.
- Do not carry locations across multiple dates unless the poster explicitly labels a shared location block.
