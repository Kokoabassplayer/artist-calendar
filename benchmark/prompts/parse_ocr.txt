Convert the OCR text into structured tour data.

Return a single JSON object and nothing else. No markdown or code fences.
Follow the schema exactly (same keys, same nesting, no extra keys):
{
  "artist_name": string,
  "instagram_handle": string|null,
  "tour_name": string|null,
  "contact_info": string|null,
  "source_month": "YYYY-MM",
  "poster_confidence": number (0-1),
  "events": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "event_name": string|null,
      "venue": string|null,
      "city": string|null,
      "province": string|null,
      "country": string,
      "time": "HH:MM"|null,
      "ticket_info": string|null,
      "status": "active"|"cancelled"|"postponed",
      "confidence": number (0-1)
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Use double quotes for all keys/strings.
- Required strings must be non-null; if unknown, use "".
- Optional strings use null when unknown.
- source_month must be YYYY-MM; infer from OCR text or event dates.
- If a date is shown as DD or DD/MM, combine with source_month to form YYYY-MM-DD.
- If a date is ambiguous or missing a day, omit that event.
- time must be HH:MM or null. If a time range is shown, use the start time only.
- status must be one of: active, cancelled, postponed.
- poster_confidence and confidence must be numbers between 0 and 1.
- Use Thailand if country is not specified.
- Keep text as written; do not translate or invent details.
- Do not guess venues or cities not present in the OCR text.
