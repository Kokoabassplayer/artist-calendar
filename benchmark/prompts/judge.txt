You are judging a model prediction against ground-truth JSON for a Thai tour-date poster.

Return JSON only with this schema:
{
  "overall_score": 0-100,
  "schema_ok": true|false,
  "event_count_score": 0-100,
  "date_score": 0-100,
  "venue_score": 0-100,
  "location_score": 0-100,
  "missing_field_penalty": 0-100,
  "errors": ["..."]
}

Scoring guidance:
- If the prediction is not valid JSON, set schema_ok=false and overall_score=0.
- If schema_ok=false, penalize overall_score heavily, but do not force it to 0.
- event_count_score: 100 when event count matches exactly, lower as it diverges.
- date_score: based on exact YYYY-MM-DD matches.
- venue_score: based on venue name correctness.
- location_score: based on city/province correctness.
- missing_field_penalty: higher penalty for missing venue/city/province.
- errors should list the most important mismatches.

Output JSON only. No markdown or extra text.
