You are given OCR text and an existing JSON extraction.
Your task is to fill missing location fields ONLY (venue, city, province, country).
Do not change any other fields, do not change event order, and do not add or remove events.

Return a single JSON object and nothing else. No markdown or code fences.
Follow the schema exactly (same keys, same nesting, no extra keys).

Rules:
- If a location field is already present (non-empty), keep it unchanged.
- Only fill location fields when the OCR text explicitly contains that information.
- If you cannot find a location for an event, keep it null/empty.
- Do not guess; do not infer beyond explicit text.
