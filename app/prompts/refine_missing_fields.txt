You are completing missing core fields in a tour-poster JSON.

You will receive:
- The poster image.
- The existing JSON that already follows the schema.

Task:
- Fill ONLY missing core fields for each event: date, venue, city, province.
- A field is missing if it is null or an empty string.
- Do NOT change any existing non-empty values.
- Do NOT add or remove events.
- Do NOT reorder events.
- If a value is not clearly present in the poster, leave it null.

Return ONLY valid JSON that matches the schema, with no extra text.
